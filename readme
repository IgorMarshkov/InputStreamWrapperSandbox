Demonstration
-------------
This example will run the demonstration of how 4 different input streams share the
limited channel. To launch example run:
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.itechart.Runner"

Note, logging operations will execute too fast so just stop the threads from console
(using Ctrl + C) to read logs.
